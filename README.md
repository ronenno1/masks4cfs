# masks4cfs
Simple script that creates masks for CFS (continuous flash suppression) studies.

Basically, the script creates png files with triangles.

The user can easily change (in the begining of the script):
1. The size of the images (in pixels)
2. The number of triangles
3. The size of the triangles
4. The number of masks

Enjoy!
